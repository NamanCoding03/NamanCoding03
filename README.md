- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NamanCoding03 - NAMAN JAIN. Let's embark on my journey.

- Welcome to my realm. Master's in Data Science from University of Glasgow, UK | AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner | Elite certificate holder in Database Management
  System (NPTEL - IIT Kharagpur) | B.Tech. in Computer Science from UPTU, India | Wish me on 23rd April.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science. One of the elite forces in the field of Technology is Data Science and I am going to be the master of this field, well well not 
      the entire field, but a niche within this.

     People say "Data Science is the sexiest job of 21st Century". Some say "It is a big tree of if-else condition". Well, I have even heard that most of the time you are just cleaning the data and its boring. 
     
     PHEWWWW, so many definitions !!!!! But leaving them aside, I genuinely like to derive insights and showcase my results to everyone. That gives me a sense of satisfaction. And for a fact, I know people will always critize something when they don't understand or unless someone proves them wrong.
     
- I will be uploading various respositories in the upcoming days which will showcase my talent. And hopefully help someone learn from them(Sharing is caring).

- I have uploaded DSA - Data Structure and Algorithm Repository where I will be uploading 2 codes on a daily basis. Currently, I am uploading the basic codes. Moving further, I will be uploading codes based on different structures such as List, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Strings, Recursion etc.

- I am compiling my machine learning playlist so that I can upload it shortly.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Tabeau. It is a Data Visualization tool. I will shortly provide link to my Tableau Public account where you can view the wonderful visualisations I have created.
